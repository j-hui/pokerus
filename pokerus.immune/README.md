# Pokerus scripts

Where I keep all the pokerus repo's helper scripts and configs.

Scripts are made available as git aliases.

Remotes for subtrees are stored under
[subtrees.config](subtrees/subtrees.config), as well as some aliases to keep
them up to date. TODO check if doing a subtree pull overwrites my own overlaid
commits.
